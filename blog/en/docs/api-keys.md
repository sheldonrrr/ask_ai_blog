# Why & What is API Keys

Many users are confused why their ChatGPT Plus or Gemini subscription doesn't work with this plugin.

## The Difference

AI companies separate their services into two types:

- **Consumer subscriptions**: For using their website or app directly
- **API keys**: For developers and tools like this plugin

These are separate services with separate billing. Your ChatGPT Plus subscription won't work here.

## Good News

You don't need to pay. Free options are available!

See [Free API Options](./free-api-options) for details.
