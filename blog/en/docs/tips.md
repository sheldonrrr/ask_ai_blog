# Tips

Get the most out of Ask AI Plugin with these tips:

## 1. Check Training Data First

First ask: "Is this book in your training data?"

If AI says no, it can't help much with specific content questions.

## 2. Use Parallel Panels

Set Parallel AI Panels to 2 in Configuration to compare different AIs side-by-side.

## 3. Be Specific

Be specific in questions for better answers.

**Instead of:** "Tell me about this book"

**Try:** "What are the main themes in this book?" or "Summarize the plot in 3 sentences"

## 4. Set Up a Detailed Persona

A detailed persona helps AI provide more relevant responses tailored to your needs.

## 5. Use Perplexity for Research

Use Perplexity for research questions that need citations and sources.

## 6. Use AI Search

Use AI Search to quickly find books in your library without browsing.

Just press `Ctrl+Shift+L` and ask in natural language.

## 7. Random Questions

Stuck on what to ask? Click Random Question (`Ctrl+R`) for inspiration.

## 8. Export Important Conversations

Use PDF Export to save valuable Q&A sessions for future reference.
